Business, Linguistics, and STEM were thriving â€” but creative disciplines were severely underrepresented. It wasn't just an oversight. It was inequality.\n\nMei had a bold idea: expand Ngee Ann's course offerings â€” to include Arts and Commerce â€” so every student, regardless of passion, had a place. She brought her proposal to Mr. Lien from the library, hoping he could help it reach the college board.\n\nAt the same time, whispers began to spreadâ€¦ Ngee Ann Kongsi was planning to transition into a full-fledged college. But the school board was livid.\n\nIn a drastic, out-of-touch move, they paused construction of the new campus â€” crushing Mei's dream of the School of Arts & Commerce. When Mei found out, she was furious.\n\nThat's when she and Kai decided â€” enough was enough. Together, they started planning a boycott. A student revolution.\n\nAs they worked side-by-side, Kai found himself falling for Mei. But he didn't knowâ€¦ it wasn't meant to last.\n\nOne of Mei's closest friends betrayed her to the board. She was expelled, just days before the protest. As she was dragged away, she looked at Kai one last time and whispered: \"This is it for me. Pleaseâ€¦ finish what we started. Goodbye.\" ðŸ’”\n\nKai had to do something.",

      content: "It had been ten years.\n\nKai stood still in the middle of the new Clementi campus, surrounded by sleek buildings and wide walkways. The student body had doubled. The architecture was modern. But for Kai, it felt hollowâ€”like something important had been paved over. The revolution had worked. The School of Arts and Commerce had been built. But Meiâ€¦ Mei wasn't here to see it.\n\nAs he wandered past the new Business Block, something caught his eyeâ€”a tree with a small bronze plaque at the base: \"Planted by Class of '63 â€“ For the Future.\" He felt a pull. Digging slightly into the soil around it, his fingers struck metalâ€”a rusted tin box. Inside: a faded poem written in Mei's handwriting, and a single line that hit him harder than anything else: \"If they forget us, then remember for me.\"\n\nThe 1990s were changing fast. In 1992, the campus had officially moved from its humble beginnings at Kim Yam Road to Clementi. By 1998, Ngee Ann launched its Centre for Computer Studies, and in 1999, became the first polytechnic in Singapore to go fully wireless. Technology was taking over. The revolution had become digitized.\n\nKai, now older and quieter, created something smallâ€”an underground student archive in a forgotten corner of the school server. He named it Echo. He scanned Mei's writings, archived protest flyers, and saved photos of their handwritten proposal. Not many knew it existed, but Kai didn't care. Mei's voice was back in the school systemâ€”not as noise, but as memory.\n\nPlaceholder: Additional content and choices will be added for Chapter 3."
